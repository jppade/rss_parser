# rss_parser
This module allows for searching a list of buzzwords in a list of rss-feeds (static/rss_list.txt). All news pages containing these words are returned. Simply run suggestNews.py and open the resulting webpage in a browser.
Optionally, the most frequent words and their relation can be visualized. It's worth mentioning that certain words (such as a, this, ...) are excluded in the visualization (see static/excluded_words.txt).
