# rss_parser
This module allows for searching a list of buzzwords in a list of rss-feeds (static/rss_list.txt). All news pages containing these words are returned. Simply run suggestNews.py and open the resulting webpage in a browser.<br>
Optionally, the most frequent words and their relation can be visualized (see explanation link on the webpage). It's worth mentioning that certain words (such as a, this, ...) are excluded in the visualization (see static/excluded_words.txt).
